# Microsoft-Sentinel-Configuration

(For a more detailed report, download the document or visit https://blog.lohitgaddipati.com)

In an effort to bolster our organization's cybersecurity posture, I configured Microsoft Sentinel, a dynamic Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. 

This involved seamless integration with key Microsoft solutions, fine-tuning data collection, implementing policy-driven compliance, and automating incident response. By creating and correlating analytic rules, we improved threat detection and streamlined incident management. 

Leveraging MITRE ATT&CK, we gained a holistic view of our security posture, while custom workbooks provided visual insights for better decision-making. 

This project reflects my commitment to advanced security measures and operational excellence.
